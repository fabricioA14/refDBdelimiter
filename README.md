## Introduction

<p align="justify">
The integration of multiple biodiversity repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has become relevant for optimizing ecological research (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.489">Curd et al., 2024</a>). However, the disparate nature of these multiple data sources poses significant challenges for researchers seeking to conduct comprehensive analyses, particularly in the context of metabarcoding studies (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13741">Jeunen et al., 2023</a>). Metabarcoding, a high-throughput sequencing approach, allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple taxa within environmental samples, providing insights into community composition and diversity (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285674">Gold et al., 2023</a>).
</p>

<p align="justify">
The proposed R package aims to streamline the metabarcoding analysis workflow by providing a cohesive framework for accessing, cleaning, and integrating GBIF occurrence data and NCBI sequences.

## Installation

The `refDBdelimiter` package is designed to be used on Windows systems. To ensure a smooth installation process, please follow these steps to meet the necessary system requirements:

1. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: This package relies on WSL for various underlying processes. To install WSL, follow these simple steps:
   
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run the following command:
     ```cmd
     wsl --install
     ```
   - Restart your computer if prompted.

   For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) documentation.

2. **Install the bdc package**:
   - First, install the `bdc` package from CRAN:
     ```r
     install.packages("bdc")
     ```

3. **DuckDB**: The `refDBdelimiter` package also depends on DuckDB for efficient data handling during the taxonomic cleaning stage. To address related issues:
   - Ensure you have the latest version of DuckDB installed.
   - If you encounter an error when trying to read a database file with an incompatible version, follow these steps. This error typically appears in functions like `bdc_query_names_taxadb`, which you might see mentioned in related issues:
     - Delete the existing database directory:
       ```r
       fs::dir_delete(taxadb:::taxadb_dir())
       ```
     - Rerun your database query:
       ```r
       resolvedspplistitis <- bdc_query_names_taxadb(sci_name=specieslist, db = "itis", suggestion_distance = 0.9)
       ```
   These steps are described in the [GitHub](https://github.com/brunobrr/bdc/issues/233) issue.

4. **GNparser**: The package requires `gnparser` for taxonomic name parsing. To resolve installation issues on Windows:
   - Download the appropriate binary file from the [GNparser](https://github.com/gnames/gnparser/releases) releases page.
   - Extract the binary file and move it to the `AppData` directory. This can be done using R:
     ```r
     unzip("path/to/gnparser.zip", exdir = "path/to/destination")
     AppData_path <- Sys.getenv("AppData")
     file.copy("path/to/destination/gnparser", file.path(AppData_path, "gnparser"), recursive = TRUE)
     ```
     
   These steps are described in this [GitHub](https://github.com/brunobrr/bdc/issues/233) issue.

Once these dependencies are met, you can install the `refDBdelimiter` package using the following commands in R:

To install the `refDBdelimiter` package, you can use the following commands in R:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install refDBdelimiter from GitHub
devtools::install_github("fabricioA14/refDBdelimiter")
```

## Features

- **Shiny Integration**: All functionalities run within an interactive Shiny app for seamless analysis and visualization.
- **Preprocessing**: Preprocess biodiversity data using various cleaning and validation steps.
- **Taxonomic Filter**: Advanced taxonomic name parsing and cleaning using multiple sources.
- **Spatial Filter**: Perform spatial validations and clean coordinates.
- **Temporal Filter**: Filter data based on temporal thresholds.
- **Interactive Map**: This stage allows for manual curation based on iterative visualization. You can curate the data manually based on a predefined area from GBIF download or by uploading a SHP file.
- **Data Saving**: Save cleaned data in multiple formats from each tab. Available formats include:
  - **Shapefile (SHP)**: Ideal for spatial data and widely used in GIS applications. Use this format when you need to perform spatial analyses in GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS. For example, mapping species distribution across different regions.
  - **GeoJSON**: A lightweight data format that is easy to share and integrate with web mapping applications. Use this format for online visualization of species distribution on platforms like Leaflet or Mapbox.
  - **GPKG (GeoPackage)**: An open format that supports large datasets and stores both vector and raster data in a single file. Use this format for comprehensive datasets that include multiple layers of biological data, such as habitats, species distributions, and environmental variables.
  - **KML**: Suitable for visualizing geographic data in Google Earth. Use this format to create interactive maps for presentations or reports, showing migration patterns or habitat ranges of species.
  - **CSV**: Versatile and widely used for tabular data. Ideal for statistical analysis and data sharing. Use this format to export cleaned occurrence data for further analysis in software like R or Excel, or to share datasets with collaborators.

Each of these formats has its unique advantages depending on the type of analysis, visualization, or data sharing needs, allowing for flexible use of the processed biodiversity data.
