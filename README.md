## Introduction

<p align="justify">
The integration of multiple biodiversity repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has become relevant for optimizing ecological research (Curd et al., 2024). However, the disparate nature of these multiple data sources poses significant challenges for researchers seeking to conduct comprehensive analyses, particularly in the context of metabarcoding studies (Jeunen et al., 2023). Metabarcoding, a high-throughput sequencing approach, allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple taxa within environmental samples, providing insights into community composition and diversity (Gold et al., 2023).

The proposed R package aims to streamline the metabarcoding analysis workflow by providing a cohesive framework for accessing, cleaning, and integrating GBIF occurrence data and NCBI sequences.
